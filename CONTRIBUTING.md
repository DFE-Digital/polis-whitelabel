# Contributing

## Development

* Changes should come in through Github pull requests.
* Pull requests should be linked back to a Github issue.
* Any pull request changes should also update the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)
* Run and make sure `e2e` tests pass before submitting a pull request. This should be confirmed in the pull request description.
* Although early changes may need to be large, try to keep pull requests focussed on the issue and not do too much else - minor code tidying/refactors in the files you are working in are fine.
* Any questions, make a comment in the pull request or issue ticket to start a discussion.
