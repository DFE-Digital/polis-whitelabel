# Contributing

Changes should come in through Github pull requests.

Pull requests should be linked back to a Github issue and labelled either a feature or bug. See previous pull requests for examples.

Any pull request changes should also update the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md)

Any questions, make a comment in the pull request or issue ticket to start a discussion.
