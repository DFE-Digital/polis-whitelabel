# Accessibility

This website is run by the [YOUR ORGANISATION HERE]. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For example, that means you will be able to:

* Change colours, contrast levels and fonts
* Zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen
* Navigate the website using just a keyboard
* Navigate the website using speech recognition software
* Listen to the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS and NVDA)
* We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.

## How accessible this website is

We know some parts of this website aren't fully accessible. In addition to the issues that fail compliance (detailed in a later section) the following are also known about:

### General accessibility issues

* Extensive use of italic text which is difficult to read for those with partial sight.
* Bold styling used for non-emphasised words causing screen readers to emphasise the wrong parts of the page.
* Dynamic feedback in the statement submission appears in different parts of the page and with different wording which makes for confusing experience.
* Errors presented as red text on white background don't have sufficient contrast in many cases.

### Observations from using JAWS screen reader

* Screen reader reads out page title but this does not update between different pages in the app making the pages indistinguishable.
* The title structure is wrong e.g. on the voting page there is a `h2` but no `h1`.
* The voting page has various sections of visually hidden text that may be useful for other users too and should be made visible.
* Some lengthy hidden error text is used to label the 'Share your perspective' text box. This is read out every time the statement box is tabbed to.
* The 'Share your perspective' text box needs a concise label.
* After voting, focus moves to the top of the page and user has to tab back down again to vote again. This also goes against the visually hidden text 'Vote success. Navigate up to see the next statement.' as the user is actually at the top of the page.
